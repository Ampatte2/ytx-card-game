    We need to keep track of each card in the game and the player lives in each signed message to verify the changes.

    Each card has the following attributes: {
        canAttack: true | false,
        cost: 1 to 10,
        life: 10 to 18,
        attack: 5 to 9,
        type: ['fire', 'water', 'wind', 'life', 'death', 'neutral'],
    }
    Each player will have up to 5 cards in the field with their life and attack, then the players will have their life
    so it will be:
        Player 1 has 58 life points:
        [card canAttack | 1cost | 5attack | 10life | water] [card 1cost | 5attack | 10life | fire] [card  1cost |5attack | 10life | neutral] [card 1cost | 5attack | 10lifeÂ | fire] [card 1cost | 5attack | 10life | death]
        vs
        Player 2 has 20 life points:
        [card 1cost | 5attack | 10life | death] [card 1cost | 5attack | 10life | life] [card 1cost | 5attack | 10life | neutral] [card 1cost | 5attack | 10life | neutral] [card 1cost | 5attack | 10life | wind]

    We can pass the cards as an array where each card is 3 values for instance, for the first player it will be:
        const cardsPlayerOne = [5, 10, 'water', 5, 10, 'fire', 5, 10, 'neutral', 5, 10, 'fire', 5, 10, 'death'] // 5 cards with their values
        const cardsPlayerTwo = [5, 10, 'death', 5, 10, 'life', 5, 10, 'neutral', 5, 10, 'neutral', 5, 10, 'wind'] // 5 cards with their values
        const playerOneLife = 58
        const playerTwoLife = 20

    We don't care about the cards in hand since they don't affect the state of the game. At least for now.

    So the signed object will be {cardsPlayerOne, cardsPlayerTwo, playerOneLife, playerTwoLife, turn}
